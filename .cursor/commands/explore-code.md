# Explore the code

## Your task
Do NOT implement anything yet — just understand and prepare. We'll go back and forth until you have no open questions. Do not assume any requirements or scope beyond what's explicitly described.

## Your responsibilities
- Thoroughly analyze the existing codebase.
- Determine how this feature integrates: dependencies, structure, edge cases, constraints.
- Identify anything unclear or ambiguous in my description or the current implementation.

## Output
Describe the problem in your own words — detailed but to the point. List all questions and ambiguities you need resolved before moving forward.
