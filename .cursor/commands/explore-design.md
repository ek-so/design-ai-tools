# Explore the design

## Input
Optional: file provided by the user describing the feature or a list of competitors to consider, that also implement the feature.

## Your task
Do NOT implement anything yet — just understand and prepare. We'll go back and forth until you have no open questions. Do not assume any requirements or scope beyond what's explicitly described.

## Your responsibilities
- If a file was provided by the user, analyze its content first.
- Think of solutions that might be applied in the described situation, and those that are already out there.
- Suggest possible alternatives, briefly describing the functionality.
- Identify anything unclear or ambiguous in my description or the current implementation.

## Output
Describe the problem in your own words — detailed but to the point. List all questions and ambiguities you need resolved before moving forward.
