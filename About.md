# Design AI Tools

**Design AI Tools** is a ready-made `.cursor/` setup for product designers and PMs who build with Cursor but don't have engineering backgrounds to craft effective AI prompts from scratch. Today, every non-engineer in Cursor starts from zero — writing vague prompts, getting mediocre outputs, and never building the kind of reusable workflows that make AI assistants genuinely useful. This project gives them a structured starting point: product discovery, competitive analysis, one-pagers, code exploration, planning, and critique — all as slash commands they can invoke without thinking. The future state is a world where a designer opens Cursor, types `/explore`, and gets a rigorous product discovery session — not because they memorized a prompt framework, but because someone already did that work for them. The benefit is compounding: every command teaches a way of thinking (validate before building, separate exploration from execution, write for humans not templates), so even when users outgrow the defaults, the habits stick.

The approach is deliberately low-tech: a public GitHub repo containing a complete `.cursor/` directory — commands, rules, and skills — that anyone can clone or copy into their project. No CLI, no npm, no dependencies. Users clone the repo, copy the `.cursor/` folder, and they're running. The commands are opinionated but editable — plain Markdown files that users can read, understand, and customize in minutes. By shipping as a GitHub repo rather than a package, we avoid the Node.js barrier that would filter out exactly the audience we're targeting. If organic traction validates demand, the same content can later be published to the Cursor Marketplace as a plugin or to PRPM for cross-platform reach — but the GitHub repo remains the source of truth and the lowest-friction entry point. The outcome for the team is a public artifact that establishes a point of view on how non-engineers should work with AI coding tools — which is a category nobody is speaking to yet.

**Open risk:** The biggest unknown is audience size. Cursor's user base skews heavily toward engineers. Whether enough designers and PMs are actually inside Cursor today — versus using Figma, Notion, or ChatGPT for their AI workflows — determines if this finds an audience or echoes into a void. Worth validating with a single social post before investing in polish.
